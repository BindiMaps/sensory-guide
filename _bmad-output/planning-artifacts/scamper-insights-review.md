## High-Value Ideas (Recommend Including)

- **Example:** "Sound issues detected → Consider noise-canceling headphones"
- **Notes:**

### 2. Wallet Card Print

- **Phase:** Growth
- **Description:** Tiny printable (wallet/phone-sized) with just: exits, bathrooms, quiet spots, emergency number

### 7. Photo-Based Warnings

- **Phase:** Growth
- **Description:** Actual photos of trigger areas, not just icons. "This is the loud PA speaker area"
- **Note:** Already have images in plan - this is about being more specific with trigger photos
- **Notes:**

we will only rely on info from the pdf to start with so that will be up to ASPECT ... we should ensure that photos are included in the spec

### 8. Text-Only Mode

- **Phase:** Growth
- **Description:** Accessibility option: no images, just structured text. Faster, cleaner, screen-reader optimized.
- **Notes:**

this is a given

## Ideas Evaluated and Rejected

- **Eliminate images entirely** - No, images add concrete value
- **Eliminate print** - No, print is non-negotiable
- **Crowd-sourced only (no pro audits)** - No, quality matters too much
- **Native app** - No, web is right choice
