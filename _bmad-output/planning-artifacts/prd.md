keyInsights:
  - "Print view is non-negotiable - must be first-class"
  - "Accessibility testing from day 1 with ASPECT"
  - "Primary value is predictability, not navigation"
  - "Before mode (desktop planning) is primary use case"
  - "LLM transformation is low-risk - admin review catches issues"
  - "Multi-tenant is a solved problem - AI builds quickly"
  - "M2 was successful - validated action plans over maps"
  - "Most existing guides are PDFs - web must demonstrably improve on this"
