# Sensory Sensitivity Wayfinding Project

> **Note:** This document contains informal notes taken during meetings, research sessions, and random thoughts throughout the project. It is not a formal specification.

# Background

## Project Executive Summary

This Sensory Sensitivity Wayfinding project will explore how digital navigation tools can better support people with sensory sensitivities when navigating complex public transport hubs.

Through co-design, consultation, and user research, the project will investigate the barriers faced in navigating public transport venues and identify the design principles required to address them.

The findings will inform the development of sensory-friendly wayfinding features, helping to shape more inclusive, user-centred mobility solutions for transport settings across Australia.

## Introduction

**The main project objective is to:**

* Produce functional prototypes (or Minimal Viable Product \- MVPs) of digital wayfinding solutions that respond to user requirements, demonstrating the feasibility and potential of sensory-friendly design.

**Sub-objectives of the project are to:**

* Develop a validated framework for sensory-sensitive wayfinding
* Deliver a set of evidence-based design guidelines and user requirements to inform the future development of inclusive navigation tools and features.
* Provide a roadmap for further development and deployment, including insights into technology, user experience, accessibility standards, and practical implementation in real-world environments.

# Scope

## Problems to solve

* Reduce sensory overload for people who suffer from sensory processing differences
* User: Planning (more so than in location)
* User: Experience "in the moment"
* Location: Discovery of issues to address in venues
* Reducing anxiety in general for visitors of a location

### AI summary of research, covering things people plan for in advance

Individuals proactively plan for visits to shopping centers and other indoor spaces by \*\*utilizing various sensory aids\*\* such as noise-cancelling headphones, earplugs, sunglasses, hats, and compression clothing.

They engage in \*\*extensive information gathering\*\* through Google Maps (photos, busy times), social media videos, VR experiences, websites (floor plans, opening hours, capacity, social stories), and by asking friends. \*\*Behavioral strategies\*\* include timing visits to avoid crowds, planning precise routes, carrying specific comfort items (e.g., personal cutlery, eucalyptus for smells), and self-advocating for necessary adjustments.

Crucially, they engage in \*\*mental preparation\*\*, building internal maps, managing expectations, budgeting personal endurance, and rehearsing interactions to cope with these environments.

## Constraints \+ Requirements

### Solution should

* Be to do with transport
* Solve actual problems for people with sensory sensitivity
* Fit well with BindiMaps tech and general philosophy
* Ideally build on existing BindiMaps tech and research
* Open up commercial opportunities with Aspect
* Be generalisable and sellable to many of BindiMaps customers
* Be technically feasible and maintainable
* Be general enough to cover multiple types of spaces, eg: Airport, train station, shopping center, supermarket, event etc
* Be secure and respect user's privacy
* Prioritise user safety and sense of safety
* Closely follow WCAG guidelines (especially those that affect autistic people)
* Follow details of contract with iMove

### Product Audience

The intended audience consists of individuals with sensory sensitivities who are sensory avoiders, including many who are autistic or neurodivergent.

For these people, navigating unfamiliar indoor spaces such as train stations, shopping centers, hospitals, and airports is often an overwhelming, disorienting, or hostile experience due to stimuli like loud, unexpected, or clashing sounds; bright, harsh, or strobing lights; strong, artificial, or clashing smells; unexpected touch, unpleasant textures and crowded environments.

This audience seeks predictability, control, and detailed information about an environment's sensory profile to manage anxiety, prepare effectively, and navigate public spaces with greater comfort.

### Challenges

* Any solution that requires content
  * Initial content production is very labor intensive
  * Will need to be actively maintained at a similarly laborious level
  * Could something with more maintainable content still have value?
* Making people aware that the eventual solution exists
* Covering the vast diversity of sensitivities and personal preferences
* Deciding which groups of people to prioritise
* Working out how to solve a problem with web technology that is fundamentally a non-technical systemic societal problem
* Finding consistent icons that work well with interactive maps
* How to present time based issues like crowds at a train station and still keep it simple without over-automating

### Assumptions

* Everyone has access to modern tech and has a phone
* Technology (specifically using maps) is a solution that will assist people afflicted with sensory sensitivities
* That knowing where personalised hazards are would increase people's quality of life

### Things to Test

* Do aspect's icons work?

## Partnership Ideas

* Approach all companies that have sensory maps
* Approach Aspect's customers?

## Research Notes

### Sensitivities

* Light/visuals
* Sound
* Crowds
* Human contact in general/proximity to people
* Textures
* Smells (not featured in vid)
* Taste (not many)
* Textures
* Synisthesia
* Lack of familiarity with space
* Patterns
* The color red(?)
* (?) high sensory/low sensory in general

### Random thoughts

* **POC thoughts**
  * Maybe the first try could be simply putting bindiweb as-is on a website and test it with no changes **as a control**… Could the first user test simply be to add a map to the station website and see what people say they miss? What works and what doesn't?
  * Co-design a feature with a person each.. Then test all the features together and see what works?
  * Survey, ask a bunch of people to suggest/vote on features that would work for them
  * Start with map on website
* In the moment
  * When people have a meltdown, they need an exit to a safe space quickly
  * If we try and tackle this we will need something very simple, otherwise we risk making the problem worse in the moment
* Don't think concentrating on one sense (eg: noise in the spec) will work given that there's so many
  * Should find a solution where it doesn't matter what the combo of sensitivities each person has
  * Have serious doubts that gps and a map "in the moment" will help.. Too inaccurate and would add stress
* Useful info
  * According to Aspect, it's estimated that one in 70 people in Australia are on the autism spectrum and have sensory differences.
  * Everyone seems to like maps and floor plans
  * Parking is a big one, people like to plan that, parking is a big unknown
  * Fear of unknown is big
    * Eg Parking, traffic
  * Pictures won't help with working out lighting\!
    * Only one time
    * Usually lighting is contrived
  * A couple of people mentioned they'd worked on creating sensory maps but haven't used one
    * Not a lot of people seem to have used them
    * Everyone says they would love one (i think they were led by the question though)
    * No one seems to have made an effort to search them out (although a lot of people go to company websites).  One person had never heard of them.
    * One guy said sensory map wouldn't help
  * Matt (ASPEC) says would be help to be able to identify quiet spaces, just to know that they are there, even if not used
  * Alexithymia
    * May not be directly related to autism

* Preparation, predictability and **planning…**
  * Majority seems to know to look at a company website to plan
  * Assuming there wasn't a selection bias in terms of who aspect found us for interviews, there's a lot of very clear signals around planning with maps
  * It really seems like this is a solved problem to some extent in certain sectors (govt, museums etc), with so many places providing action plans or sensory maps or both
    * Haven't found any good examples of interactive maps yet though
  * Everyone planned extensively although no one mentioned action plans specifically in the interviews despite this being an industry standard, sensory maps were used rarely
  * People do massive amounts of research…  *but not everyone*
  * basically everything about it
  * Maps for planning, action plan for" in the moment"??
  * Dry runs
  * *Where* smells, noises etc are is probably less important than *when* to go somewhere, since they may not be able to avoid these things even if they know where they are (?)
    * Maybe not entirely true.. Since being pre-warned is also useful
  * Almost everyone says they check the website before hand but no one uses or tries to use a sensory map
  * More valuable than once they visit
  * "Planning most important"
  * We might have to prioritise accuracy over scope or features otherwise if we have inaccuracies it defeats the purpose of building anything
  * Airport group story (\#3) nightmare… content on website was wrong
  * Not everyone wanted very careful planning, **roughly half the interviewees were happy to wander around without planning**
    * participants exhibit a range of behaviors regarding planning before going out, from meticulous pre-planners who stick strictly to their routes to those who tend to explore or react to situations as they arise.
  * Many examples of people being ok when they have control (predictability)
    * Eg: blasts loud music to cope even if normally loud music triggers her… (channel blocking, flooding senses)
  * Maybe a way for the user to plan things out and create a "visual story" just for them?\!?\!?\!?
    * Presets
    * Printable
    * Eg

  * When a plan goes awry, it's worse than the sensory input itself
* **Accurate information\! Content** (especially time based) is going to be killer, maybe we need a system to get people to update
  * How to sort this people-wise? some one has to take photos every 6 months, track building works etc
  * Should we try and only do things that are sustainable? Eg: keeping data up to date won't be unless we solve that .. ie is there a point doing something that will lose steam because of content issues?
  * Given that people freak out for unexpected change…Maybe we need a system to keep content up to date… if the content is not up to date we should pull the info
    * Tell the user last updated??
    * Somehow prod people to update info…
    * Mark when info is stale
    * \*\*\*\* this might be a showstopper if we can't maintain content
  * Given that everyone is so different,, we defo need a social aspect for this
    * Will still need someone paid to keep things up to date and make it look like a lot of people are adding content
    * At least comments from other users about places
    * Compare notes?
    * What sort of critical mass would we need to make this work?
* Pondering
  * All the people interviewed have been through some kind of coaching with aspect… what amount of the population would have that coaching? Wondering how representative the 10 were, would that bias the research?
  * We could try and tailor information directed at lots of different types of sense, or we could generalise with "high" and "low" sensitivity?
  * We are definitely going to need an expert designer who works in the domain
  * Even though sensory maps will probably end up being part of our solutions, wondering if the research was a little biased towards that as the only solution?
  * Who/how do we get the data we use?
    * Data best collected by someone with SS lived experience (not gadgets and things)
    * A way to report/crowd source the info we need? Smells, noise, light, crowd
  * Get feedback about if we helped (thumbs up/down)
    * Could our angle be using the app to report feedback and tag.. We might not even need to feed this back into BW, could send to Aspect
      * … ie flip it around… use it as an app to report not help
  * People will have to know about the app, they won't just find it so feature will need to assume that
  * Since we're trialing at a railways station, the whole point of the trip would be for catching the train so we'll need timetables for sure
  * No matter what this will have to be WCAG compliant and simple to use
  * Some kind of gamification could be good, whatever we build
  * Tracking.. Will need lots of that
    * How do we measure this in general? Not just usage but usefulness
  * Don't do
    * Anything that relies on data that isn't going to be accurate
      * GPS
      * Crowd data from an API
    * Anything complex or that needs learning from the user
  * A lot of talk about avoiding problems.. Be good to look at things that work… like if someone used our system would they just get triggered by other things? Could we end up playing wackamole? Eg a lot of these things would be impossible to avoid

### Questions

* Matt \+ team
  * What was the research that drew you to creating sensory maps as a business?
  * What are the pain points for you for making maps
    * Pain points for users using you maps.. Are we solving any og that?
  * How do you like to work?
  * Explain our usual process
  * Define roles
  * Set expectations about what's possible/realistic
  * Who are our target audience (define carefully)
  * ~~Examples of paper maps using aspect icons~~
  * ~~Get vectors of icons~~
  * ~~Color guide~~
* Challenge the assumption that Adelaide RS is the best place to develop… are there enough problems for people there?
* Look at two approaches
  * Take what we have and build on that (based on feedback) eg maps, apis etc
  * Build something new (based on feedback) and incorporate what we have
* Op solution tree
* What are the ways people solve their sensory problems now besides what we found in research? (with tech?)
  * Are maps a good solution in general?
  * Are there any barriers to people using maps that we might have to take into account?
  * How do they plan now?
  * Find out what most people would do… eg: google maps, street view, destination website (and where do they go, what is helpful?),
* Issues specific to transport? Obv crows… anything else?
* Clients with visual stories
* Do Adelaide rail (or any partners) have anything physical set up for SS peeps? Quite rooms, spaces etc
* Personal opinion on our research
  * Was 10 people enough?
  * Do you think the signals that came out were representative? Any selection bias? For example everyone was a planner… is this genuinely a big thing?
  * Our research was heavily biased towards sensory maps as a solution, wondering what other options we could explore
* Any other companies that are doing this that you know of?
  * wayfinding/journey/tech
* Can we identify problems specific to transport places,
  * Train stations
* Planning is a strong-ish signal coming out of all the research
  * Could it be a mistake to simply replicate that? Or better to use tech to help reduce how much planning is needed?
  * Only 10 people…How common is this really?
  * Is it fair to say that the more prepared someone is the better… if there are loud noises/light etc is the discomfort reduced if they know its coming?
* More research needed
  * When people make a plan currently, how do they record the plan and use it in the moment?
  * If people make a solid plan, how to correct situations where the plan changes, they go off track, or unexpected situation happens
  * Would even just having a map on a phone be a source of discomfort? Ie managing multiple things, screen lock etc etc
  * What's the usage like for paper maps now (when they are available)? Are they accepted generally by people?
    * How do they get them if they aren't in the venue yet?
  * What social media exists where people exchange info about this? Do they? Is this a large way that people do planning or avoid things they don't like or generally support each other
  * Do we have enough data within reason now to start planning? Do we need more interviews?
    * Maybe about public transport?
* If we did some kind of gamification, or made it social (public reporting etc) would people be likely to use it? Or would that add to their load?
* What things are just not worth trying to solve?
* Will we ever need a slider for time? If we can solve with text then we can bake the icons etc into digital maps
* Can we get away with venue images and not need bindiview
  * Or use BV differently?
* What would aspect do if someone gave them a bunch of money and a development team?
  * Perfect world, what would you build??
  * Have they done this in the past?
  * Would be good to explore options that aren't the obvious ones (sensory map etc)
* If we do crowd sourcing
  * we're going to need someone available on the ground to update things
  * Will need moderation for things that get published online
  * Either way someone will be getting info to triage
* In general, what's the largest group that we could help (ideally with the least effort) … is there an 80/20 rule we could follow?

### Unofficial Random Unsorted Feature Ideas \+ Notes

* Obvious digital sensory maps with polygons/colors/icons etc
  * Turn on and off layers etc "what do you want to avoid?"
  * Times of day are very important.. Especially for lighting
  * Will need to make it easy for people to maintain… could be a good excuse to finish the geojson editor
  * mobile/desktop/tablet?
  * Might need to look into scheduling info we show… things can change at times of day
    * Maybe even for pictures???
    * Temporal stuff came up A LOT
  * Timestamp all info … people need to have trust that it hasn't changed
  * Notes could be personal just for the user, or submitted to aspect/company etc
  * "Crowd calendar" "popularity"
    * Could estimate this rather than try and make it perfect.. Could have notes on there too to hedge any bad data
    * Wait times? Would be good for hospitals/airports etc
  * Show duration of hazard if it's temporary?
  * People like color codes, red-green stuff (even though it's not colorblind accessible)
  * Will need to massively enhance content.. Eg websites for all POIs, open hours etc
  * If we're annotating for various sensitivity profiles, we will need to capture intensity too, not just there or not there
  * Ceiling height is good information for some people, maybe pics would help with that
  * Potentially have the map customised for the user
    * Created in the planning app
  * 2 use cases re what's happening at a particular time
    * User chooses time and we show situation at that ime
    * User chooses time that is quietest/brightest (for example) and we show them best time
  * Change list so people know what's changed since they last planned .. maybe even email them?
  * Icons will need  full explanation
  * Besides zones with icons, color (for intensity), should be able to tap and get more information/text etc
    * Eg what the sound is, what the smell is
  * Tips/advice

    * [https://www.lib.ncsu.edu/sensory-friendly-maps](https://www.lib.ncsu.edu/sensory-friendly-maps)
  * Will need to describe conditions overall not just polygons and things
    * Ie: whole hospital can be bright… etc
  * SOLVES: most things on the list
* Planning, customise your visual story (action plan/visual story/social stories)
  * No one in the interviews actually mentioned this
  * Print out
  * Email/whatsapp etc
    * Button at each step open options for existing or quiet room (safety button)
  * Could these stories be used for BVI people too?
  * Should be able to add personal planning notes as well
    * Like "order muffins" from x shop
  * LLM could be involved in here too?
  * At every step, needs a way to report if something is different (message goes to venue and aspect for them to update content)
  * Route out as well as in?
  * We should start with a template that staff could create
    * Could stuff edit this?
  * Always need how to get out, even just for when they are leaving
    * Closest exit \+ best exit
  * "Quietest times" rather than graphs of times? Or some combo?
  * Button to instantly route to quiet space? Like a quiet icon always visible
    * Even just to help them know it existed
    * How do we deal with where they currency are though?
    * How about a "safety" button or some other name.. Which opens a list of categories like quiet space, exit etc.. again problem is knowing where they currently are
  * Soft and calming colors
    * No one seems to like red or saturated colors
  * Depending on the preferences they chose, we could suggest tools to help (not just familiarisation)
    * Eg .. get some/bring your noise-cancelling headphones, earplugs, sunglasses, hats, and compression clothing
    * What other info like this can we get from aspect?
  * Some audio component?
    * A lot of people wear headphones out
    * "Read out next step" or something?
  * Images for sure
    * Even just so people can plan what to buy.. Eg knowing what food they will order when they get there
  * Feedback button (or something more enticing)
    * First ask how they are feeling? Stress levels etc (for our metrics) .. could at least use this for in-person testing
    * Get feedback
  * Multi-language
  * Will need instructions along with venues etc
    * Eg laptop security story
    * we should use text to explain what will need to be done and what to do
    * "Do i tap on, not tap on" … could leverage travelling experiences for this
  * Photosphere
  * Snippet of sound to expect at that time of day?
  * Videos helpful but not for everyone
  * Always button to show where quite space is
  * If action plan is re-used online.. We should mark changes that have happened since?
  * Warning if the info is likely to change?
    * Maybe some indication of how reliable the info is?
  * Map between each bit with route shown from last destination
  * Action plan needs to cover whole journey.. Not just inside.. Include transport to
  * Reports would need time limits… ie temporary construction .. temporary closures… someone will need to re-check after a time limit
  * Some kind of back-end for reporting stats and feedback etc from plan
  * Phone numbers for people to ring?
    * Have that prominent? Maybe include in the "help" section
  * Once people know a place they usually feel better about it..
    * Could get people who know a place to contribute
    * Same UI would also be used by auditors
  * SOLVES: people who need extensive planning and no surprises
* Reporting issues app
  * Use BW as a reporting or research tool for identifying issues and sending them to the right place
    * Annotate on map
    * Write report on each situation
  * Might actually get more usage out of this that the other way around
  * Aspect can use this to get in touch with potential customers to make things better
  * Ideally feedback could be added with voice to make it quick and easy for auditors
    * Maybe transcript later
  * Could generate a report like this
    [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1psteAcl3CWV1Y5zbAJqLZ28R98C0kPbL](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1psteAcl3CWV1Y5zbAJqLZ28R98C0kPbL)
  * SOLVES: Aspect's outreach and possibly get them more work. Lets building managers/owners know about problems
* Info
  * "Laptop bag" at airport thing
  * Info based on time of day
  * In between each step "need a break? The nearest x is over there etc"
  * From aspect
    * Am I likely to encounter any challenges or changes (delays, waiting, volume etc.)?
    * What do I do if these occur?
    * Who can help me?
    * Where can I go if I feel overwhelmed? (i.e. Quiet areas)
  * We should email (wat'app etc) them if there are any changes to the SS content
* Be good to use landmarks for directions
* Examples

  * SOLVES: people who need extensive planning and no surprises
* Feedback/social
  * Some way for people to
    * Communicate issues back to building/aspec
    * Communicate issues to bindiweb for content management
    * Social aspect, peopole to discuss things? Solve problems together? Get feedback
  * Would need this to go both ways, users would need feedback on their feedback and to know what actions have been taken
  * Action plan… "others have …"
  * "Have you been here before? share your experience with others"
  * Story (from \#1) about asking shop keeper to turn music down.. We also know that some people don't like physical interaction
  * General feedback, not just for a place.. Place could be useful but optional
  * "Waze for life" (\#5) referring to a big button to report accidents in waze
  * SOLVES: communication with venue managers and owners and even shop owners about existing SS issues
  * Would need moderation too.. Someone needs to do that
* Rerouting around certain areas depending on preference
  * This was floated but decided wasn't very useful
  * SOLVES: not much
* For "in the moment" usage, since GPS will be poor and confusing.. If people get off track they will need to find themselves… Could we do this with images?
  * Ie show images of inside to people to help locate where they are so they can locate themselves and navigate from there?
  * This might not need to be in the BW app, could be in the action list
* Kiosks or help points
  * SOLVES: reduce need for people to communicate with humans, possibly even have sensory directions
  * Distribute large amounts of small cheap kiosks around the place so that there's always a way to find where you are and how to get places
  * Kiosks (help points) could be prominently displayed and very noticeable
  * Could include searchable transport information in them too?
  * Alternatively QR codes around the place with links to BW?
* Photos (bindiview)
  * Show pictures along routes (or anywhere)
  * Pictures of venues, corridors etc
  * A lot of content to keep up to date
  * Would need pictures at different times of day for lighting
  * SOLVES: planning,orientation and sussing out potential visual issues
* (tony) Display more detailed information about a space:
  * Video walk-throughs (bindiview or similar?)
  * "Social curriculum". What to expect when you get there and for certain points. Eg, In an airport, do I take my laptop out of my bag or not?
  * Sensory information, but tie it to time of day or other factors to make it more relevant than a static sensory map.
  * A "visual story" about a space. This is a thing that some locations put on their website as a kind of a briefing for someone who's going there. [Here's an example](https://australian.museum/visit/access/visual-story/). The Australian Museum is a client of ASPECT. Here's [their accessibility page](https://australian.museum/visit/accessibility-and-inclusion/)
  * Highlight quiet spaces somehow. Whether a space has them, how many, where they are etc.
* (tony) Dynamic, current information is important
  * Mat talked about allowing crowd-sourced data like Waze does
  * Transport hubs have APIs that could be proxies for crowdedness
  * How could we get dynamic information about noise? Is this actually feasible at all?
* Use train occupancy info by itself
  * realtime-on-site
  * Doesn't need to be a proxy for anything… just show people which carriage is the quietest
    * Ie list of trains coming, platforms and which carriage is quietest
  * SOLVES: avoiding crowds
* Go full planning vers.. Do full interactive videos, 3d, the works but just for planning.. Keep it simple… 250k planning poc
  * 3d walkthrough? Get a camera etc
  * Do this? [https://go.matterport.com/Capture-Service.html](https://go.matterport.com/Capture-Service.html)
    (could at least test this)
* Anything we could do with AR?
* Crowd/occupancy
  * Could spend the whole budget just solving this one
  * If we can't get popular times etc we could simply hard code
    * Doesn't have to be automated???
    * "Popular times" would have to come with opening times too (since popular times would be zero when closed)
    * Could scrape google for this if we had to (no api right now) every so often
      [https://github.com/m-wrzr/populartimes/blob/master/populartimes/crawler.py](https://github.com/m-wrzr/populartimes/blob/master/populartimes/crawler.py)
      [https://github.com/philshem/gmaps\_popular\_times\_scraper](https://github.com/philshem/gmaps_popular_times_scraper)
  * SOLVES: people who don't like crowds
* OSM rating places
  * Think of the larger world rather than one location.. So we'd rate and warn about the friendliness of  individual locations rather than granularly map one location
  * Kind of like what this app does
    * [https://www.kron4.com/business/press-releases/ein-presswire/648978421/introducing-neurohub-a-pioneering-step-towards-a-sensory-friendly-world/](https://www.kron4.com/business/press-releases/ein-presswire/648978421/introducing-neurohub-a-pioneering-step-towards-a-sensory-friendly-world/)

# Meeting notes

ASPECT meeting notes

Monday... what's needed there? Plan?
Do I need to put things live??

Garry mentioned …Data…

DO

* Send Gary and Bec floor plans
  * something they can write on (archetypal floor plan)
* Will need to be careful re feature requests.. and not biasing the research… would be interesting to see what signals come up

## Aspect interview  28/nov 2025

GARY

questions
\* what do you need to know to catch up?
\* demo BW
\* visual story… thinking of integrating that in our proct with links to show maps
	\* is that ok? Part of the deal?
	\* content useful to people?
	\* ideas around that?
	\* word format or similar
\* somehow get overlays on to map (no legend)
	\* pretty major part of it
	\* get feedback

Interesting bits
Pivot to visual stories??
Visual stories can be great with too much information but also overwhelming\!
… hmmmmm
"Some people only need the information that's relevant to them.. some people need every bit of information"
"should provide bare bones information but if someone needs more they can access it"
"if you do too much from the start it locks a whole group of people out"
How about
\> Headline
\> Map | Images | More detail…
Had list of categories that he thinks are more useful
He made a working prototype\!\!

Popup descriptions.. adamant that there should be pictures
Thinks it's important to filter what you see (categories))
Showed bindiview
Loves it
.. first impression was the circles were too big zoomed out… looked good zoomed in

Gary to give me better overlays and also annotate where each comment was in the pdf so we can add links to map there

## Findings notes for report

* Plan was to do a minimal mvp with as few assumptions as possible in order to not bias testing and let users guide the next steps
* Did the simplest thing we could do without making any assumptions.. Ie we started several direction but didn't go too far.. This is so as not to bias testing and hopefully be surprised by what we find
* Action plan seems more priority and richer for adelaide.. pivot
* Wasn't a huge use for overlays so far
* Did poc with aspec making their own maps.. Identified some missing categories
  * Maps a re clearly way too busy: recommend a way to turn them on and off and a key
* Get feedback from gary re how easy the maps were to make.. And any suggestions there
  * Suggestions for missing categories
    * Image 1 \- this is a sensory opportunity to view the artwork in the cabinet \- marked here as brightlight
    * Image 2 \- This is the ramp we discussed the other day that had the steep slope, and shiny floor. \- area near crunchybites
* Airports shot maps and action plans
* Focus group takeaways
  * People really expected more of a google maps experiencer, especially when it comes to street view
  * Bindiview tested badly (especially the ui as it is)
  * Level picker tested badly
  * Maps didn't even test that well for ss folks
    * Needs a filter
    * Too crowded and noisy with ss overlays+icons
  * Clearly always been a problem shoehorning problem into a map (our hammer etc)
* Potential new plan
  * Action plan focused on planning
    * Simple design design
    * Embedded maps
    * Photos
    * Link to map for using in
    * Print version
  * Action plan CMS
    * Choose image potentially from
