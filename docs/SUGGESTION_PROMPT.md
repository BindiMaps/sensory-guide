## Common Elements Found in Quality Social Stories & Visual Guides

Based on analysis of 12+ real-world examples from museums, airports, shopping centres, community centres, and science centres, the following patterns consistently appear in effective accessible guides:

### 1. Narrative Structure
- **First-person perspective** throughout ("I will...", "I can...", "I am going to...")
- **Sequential/chronological journey** format (arrival → experience → departure)
- **Simple, short sentences** - typically 1-2 sentences per concept
- **Concrete, observable details** rather than abstract concepts
- **Present tense** for immediacy and clarity

### 2. Visual-Verbal Pairing
- Every section includes **real photographs** of actual locations/experiences
- Images show **what the visitor will actually see**
- Text and images are **directly correlated** - no generic stock photos
- Multiple formats offered (PDF, DOCX, PPTX, web)

### 3. Sensory Information
- **Sound levels** for each area (quiet/ambient/loud/noisy)
- **Lighting conditions** (dim/regular/bright/flashing/strobing)
- **Specific sensory warnings** for individual exhibits or areas
- **"High Sensory" callouts** listing potential triggers:
  - Loud bangs, sudden noises
  - Flashing/strobing lights
  - Crowded spaces
  - Strong smells
  - Tactile sensations

### 4. Practical Logistics
- Opening hours and contact details
- **Toilet/restroom locations** (including accessible facilities)
- **Quiet spaces** explicitly identified with locations
- Food/drink options with sensory notes
- **Staff identification** (uniforms, name badges, where to find help)
- Parking and entry procedures
- Ticket/booking information

### 5. Behavioral Preparation
- Turn-taking and sharing expectations
- Walking vs running guidance
- Voice level expectations
- Staying with group/family
- What to do if separated
- Rules stated positively ("I can..." rather than "Don't...")

### 6. Coping Strategies & Support
- **Quiet spaces** with specific locations
- Noise-canceling headphones availability/location
- Break options and where to take them
- Sensory bags/kits available
- **Who to ask for help** and how to identify them
- Wristbands for contact details
- Private rooms available on request

### 7. Reassurance & Empowerment
- Normalising statements ("It's okay if...")
- Safety statements where relevant
- **Choice and agency language** ("I can choose...", "I don't have to...")
- Duration/timing information for predictability
- Positive closing statements
- Acknowledgment that leaving early is okay

### 8. Pre-Visit Guidelines (for carers/parents)
- Read story 1-2 weeks in advance
- Read in distraction-free environment
- Monitor comprehension
- Revisit after visit to celebrate success

### 9. Venue-Specific Additions
- **Quiet times** (when venue is less busy)
- **Sensory maps** showing intensity levels across the space
- Show/performance schedules with sensory ratings
- Content warnings for sensitive topics
- Contact information for accessibility questions

## Analysis Prompt

When you have a draft social story or visual guide to analyse, use the following prompt:

```
You are an accessibility specialist with expertise in creating social stories and visual guides for neurodivergent visitors (particularly those with autism, sensory processing differences, or cognitive disabilities).

I will provide you with a draft social story or visual guide. Please analyse it against the following criteria and provide specific, actionable suggestions for improvement:

- [ ] Identifies specific sensory triggers (loud noises, flashing lights, crowds, smells)
- [ ] Highlights "high sensory" areas/exhibits explicitly

### Practical Information
- [ ] States opening hours

## Your Task

1. **Score** the draft against each criterion (Met / Partially Met / Not Met)
2. **Identify gaps** - what key information is missing?
3. **Suggest specific additions** - provide example text for missing elements
4. **Flag potential issues** - language that could be confusing, missing sensory warnings, etc.
5. **Prioritise improvements** - which changes would have the biggest positive impact?

Please be specific and practical in your suggestions. Include example text where helpful.
